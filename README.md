# PiP World Tokenomics Dashboard

Welcome to the **PiP World Tokenomics Dashboard**! This interactive Streamlit app offers a detailed simulation and analysis tool for $PiPS token investors and ecosystem participants, helping users make data-driven investment decisions through advanced tokenomics metrics and visualizations.

## Overview

This dashboard is designed to visualize and simulate the tokenomics of the PiP World ecosystem. With features that cover everything from token supply distribution to market cap growth, this tool provides insights into token price, circulating supply, and other financial metrics over customizable timeframes. Key functionalities allow users to explore how different investment timings, market caps, and growth strategies impact the value of $PiPS tokens.

## Features

- **Token Distribution Analysis**: Visualize token allocation across various funding rounds and ecosystem categories with a dynamic pie chart.
- **Market Cap Simulation**: Set initial market cap and growth rates to simulate market cap growth over a chosen timeframe.
- **Token Price Projections**: Calculate and chart projected token prices based on user-selected metrics, market cap, and circulating supply.
- **Interactive Growth Modeling**: Adjust growth multipliers to explore different scenarios for token price evolution.
- **Dynamic Data Visualizations**: Toggle between multiple visualizations (e.g., Token Price Growth, Market Cap Growth) and view charts and tables with Plotly.

## Installation for Own Data Analysis
